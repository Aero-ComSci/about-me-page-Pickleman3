    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<div>
    <p class = "whoami"> My name is Saiutkarsh Choudarypally. I have a brother and we live in Dublin CA. My mom and dad are both sofware engineers. I like every sport and enjoy almost everything. I love making friends and talking about... I legally can't say it in school, but let's get say it involves dark humor. My favorite food is biriyani. Right now I'm focusing on archery and badminton. I'm planning on getting a good state rank. I love reasoning, and arguing one side.    </p>

    <h2>Career goals</h2>
    <p>As of right now I don't really know my dream job. I'm looking at finance because it make a lot of money, and it's incredbile easy to get into,
        however I'm not really sure if that's the best play for me. My mom wants me to go into biomed, but I really don't like human stuff. I also don't like working
        for 12 years to get a job as a doctor. My dad wants me to go into engineering but as of right now, I'm not sure if engineering is the best choice for me. 
        I like having fun while doing a job. I don't like coding, nor do I like the "EngIneRing mInD". I just want to make money, by any means that's not illegal.
        My current goals right now would be working out and sports. 
    </p>
    <h2>Strengths and personal qualities</h2>
        <p>Apperantly I am realy cracked at almost every sport I play. I'm a natural and I really love sports, but sometimes it becomes a curse because it takes up so much
            time. For example I joined a volleyball club. Now at the beggining I liked volleyball, but after a few classes. I really started to hate it. It takes up around 9~
            hours every week, on monday and wednesdsays. It got really annoying and I started to hate volleyball. And don't even get me started on the tournaments. Why the hell are they so far away
            .Anways. Some personal qualities I have would be kind, open-minded, and empathetic. Now I really don't believe in any of these but apperently my friends certainly thinks so 
            So. Yeah. 
        </p>
    <h2>Important achievements</h2>
        <p> Some major achievements from highschool would definitely be the debate tournaments.
             Well, hopefully. I have 3 tournaments in the next month, and I’m writing this before, so I’m going
              to hope that I did well. Some activities that I participated in would be chess, archery, 
              and obviously speech and debate.</p>
    <h2>Your abilities and work skills</h2>
    <p>Something that I learned about myself from my experience would be that I'm extremely weak. 
        So I started working out, and now my friends say I’m jacked, but I don’t really want to say that in this. 
        Some difficulties I’ve been dealing with as of right now would be Honors Chemistry, and Spanish.
         To be completely honest, this semester is a lot easier than the first one, but I’m still struggling with 
         spanish. Spanish is just a subject where it’s impossible to get it right the first time. </p>
